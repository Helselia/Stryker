# Toku

Toku is an RPC Bridging protocol based off of Discord's [Loqui](https://github.com/discord/loqui). Currently, the protocol has support for Python (2 & 3) and Elixir. Rust support and Scala support are pending a review and rewrite.

You can find the code for each language on its respective branch.
